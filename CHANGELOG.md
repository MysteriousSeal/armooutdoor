# Changelog

All notable changes to this project since the initial commit are documented here, newest first.

## 2026-08-14 (2)

- **Customers now have a first and last name** instead of a single "name" field:
  - `users.first_name`/`users.last_name` (NOT NULL), `name` column dropped; existing users backfilled by splitting the old name, with a fake surname generated for single-word names.
  - `User::name` kept as a computed accessor so the many places that just *display* a name (order facts, header greeting, admin lists) needed no changes.
  - Registration, account profile editing, and the manual-order "new external customer" form all collect first/last name separately; admin customer/order search now matches against both fields.
- **Manual order creation for admin** (`/admin/orders/create`):
  - Pick an existing customer or create a lightweight "external" one inline (hidden from the customers list and dashboard count).
  - Add products with quantities and optional per-line price overrides, a required carrier (priced via the normal free-shipping rules, with an optional shipping price override), and shipping/billing addresses. Payment method is fixed to card.
  - Stock is decremented in a locked transaction, matching the regular checkout flow.
  - Customer and product fields use a searchable autocomplete widget; picking an existing customer can reuse one of their saved addresses.

## 2026-08-14

- **Breadcrumbs**: order detail page now links through Accueil → Votre compte → Commandes instead of jumping straight to the order.
- **Customer order pages**:
  - Added a "Télécharger la facture" button on the order detail page and a matching download icon on each card in the orders list, both shown only once an order is past *placed*/*preparing*.
  - New `orders.invoice` route, ownership-checked, reusing the same PDF as admin.
  - Refunded orders now show the refunded amount under the order total.
  - The hero message under the order number now reflects the actual status (placed, preparing, shipped, refunded) instead of one static sentence for every order.
- **Admin orders list**: added quick stats (orders to prepare, missing tracking) and a per-row invoice download icon, consolidated into the actions column next to "View".
- **Invoice PDF**:
  - Rebuilt as a real Blade template rendered with `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf` (company header, order/invoice/date meta, shipping & billing addresses, itemized table with product thumbnails, shipping notes, totals) — replaces the original hand-rolled placeholder PDF.
  - Fixed page margins (top/bottom/left/right) via body padding after `@page` margin proved unreliable in dompdf.
  - Refunded orders: Total TTC is zeroed and a "Remboursement" line (negative of subtotal + shipping) is added.
  - VAT footer mention set to the CIBS article reference.
- **Refunded order status**: new terminal status, selectable from any point in the order lifecycle (placed/preparing/shipped) via its own confirmation modal; styled consistently across badges and the status history timeline in both themes.
- **Order shipping/billing address editing**: admins can now edit an order's addresses from a modal while the order is still *placed* or *preparing*. Editing only overwrites the order's own address snapshot — the customer's saved address book is never touched. Editability is allowlist-based so future statuses are locked out by default.
- **Package types**: new admin-managed list (Settings → Shipping) of shipping package types, selectable when adding tracking to an order. The chosen name is snapshotted onto the order so it stays accurate even if the package type is later renamed or deleted; also shown on the customer-facing tracking section.
- **Legal pages**: extracted a shared header/nav partial across the four legal pages (CGV, mentions légales, confidentialité, droit de rétractation) and switched mentions légales to a definition-list layout for company facts.
- **README**: replaced the default Laravel boilerplate with real project documentation covering storefront/admin features, stack, and local setup steps.
